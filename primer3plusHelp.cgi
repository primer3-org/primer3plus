<h2><a name="introduction">2. INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p>Primer3 picks primers for PCR reactions, considering as criteria:
<br>
o oligonucleotide melting temperature, size, GC content,
  and primer-dimer possibilities,<br>
<br>
o PCR product size,<br>
<br>
o positional constraints within the source (template) sequence, and<br>
<br>
o possibilities for ectopic priming (amplifying the wrong sequence)<br>
<br>
o many other constraints.<br>
<br>
All of these criteria are user-specifiable as constraints, and
some are specifiable as terms in an objective function that
characterizes an optimal primer pair.<br>

<h2><a name="licenseExplain">4. FAIR USE OF PRIMER3</a></h2>

<p>
The development of primer3 is promoted by a small group of 
enthusiastic scientists mainly in their free time.They do not gain 
any financial profit with primer3.<br>
<br>
There are two groups of primer3 users: end users, who run 
primer3 to pick their primers and programmers, who use primer3 
in their scripts or software packages. We encourage both to use 
primer3.
<br>
<br>
If you are an end user, we request but do not
require that use of this software be cited in publications
as listed above under CITING PRIMER3.
<br>
<br>
If you are a programmer, you  will see that primer3 is now 
distributed under the GNU  General Public License, version 2 or 
(at  your option) any later version of the License (GPL2). 

As we understand it, if you include parts of the primer3 source 
code in your source code or link to primer3 binary libraries in 
your executable, you have to release your software also under 
GPL2. If you only call primer3 from your software and interpret 
its output, you can use any license you want for your software. 
If you modify primer3 and then release your modified software, 
you have to release your modifications in source code under 
GPL2 as well.
<br>
<br>
We chose GPL2 because we wanted primer3 to evolve and for the 
improvements to find their way back into the main distribution. 

If you are programming a new web interface which runs primer3, 
please include in the about page of the tool the sentence 
"&lt;your software name&gt; uses primer3 version ...". 
Please consider releasing your software under GPL2 as well, 
especially if you do not want to maintain it in the future. 
<br>
<br>
There is no need to ask us for permission to include primer3 
in your tools.

<h2><a name="pickAdvice">5. ADVICE FOR PICKING PRIMERS</a></h2>

<p>We suggest consulting: Wojciech Rychlik (1993) "Selection of
Primers for Polymerase Chain Reaction" in BA White, Ed., "Methods
in Molecular Biology, Vol. 15: PCR Protocols: Current Methods and
Applications", pp 31-40, Humana Press, Totowa NJ.</p>

<h2><a name="cautions">6. CAUTIONS</a></h2>

<p>Some of the most important issues in primer picking can be
addressed only before using primer3. These are sequence quality 
(including making sure the sequence is not vector and not chimeric) 
and avoiding repetitive elements.<br>
<br>
Techniques for avoiding problems include a thorough understanding
of possible vector contaminants and cloning artifacts coupled
with database searches using blast, Fasta, or other similarity
searching program to screen for vector contaminants and possible
repeats.  Repbase (J. Jurka, A.F.A. Smit, C. Pethiyagoda, and
others, 1995-1996, <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/repbase/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/repbase/</a>)
is an excellent source of repeat sequences and pointers to the
literature.  (The Repbase files need to be converted to Fasta format
before they can be used by primer3.) Primer3 now allows you to screen
candidate oligos against a Mispriming Library (or a Mishyb Library in
the case of internal oligos).<br>
<br>
Sequence quality can be controlled by manual trace viewing and
quality clipping or automatic quality clipping programs.  Low-
quality bases should be changed to N's or can be made part of
Excluded Regions. The beginning of a sequencing read is often
problematic because of primer peaks, and the end of the read
often contains many low-quality or even meaningless called bases.
Therefore, when picking primers from single-pass sequence it is
often best to use the <a href="#SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION</a> parameter to 
ensure that primer3 chooses primers in the high quality region 
of the read.<br>
<br>
In addition, primer3 takes as input a <a href="#SEQUENCE_QUALITY">SEQUENCE_QUALITY</a> list for
use with those base calling programs (e.g. Phred)
that output this information.</p>

<h2><a name="findNoPrimers">7. WHAT TO DO IF PRIMER3 CANNOT FIND ANY PRIMERS?</a></h2>

<p>Try relaxing various parameters, including the
self-complementarity parameters and max and min oligo melting
temperatures.  For example, for very A-T-rich regions you might
have to increase maximum primer size or decrease minimum melting
temperature.  It is usually unwise to reduce the minimum primer
size if your template is complex (e.g. a mammalian genome), since
small primers are more likely to be non-specific.  Make sure that
there are adequate stretches of non-Ns in the regions in which
you wish to pick primers.  If necessary you can also allow an N
in your primer and use an oligo mixture containing all four bases
at that position.<br>
<br>
Try setting the <a href="#PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG">PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG</a> input tag.</p>

<h2><a name="sequenceTags">8. "SEQUENCE" INPUT TAGS</a></h2>

<p>"Sequence" input tags start with SEQUENCE_... and describe a 
particular input sequence to primer3. They are reset after every 
Boulder record. Errors in "Sequence" input tags invalidate the 
current record, but primer3 will continue to process additional 
records.</p>

</table>
<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_ID">SEQUENCE_ID (string; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>Short description of the sequence. It is used as an identifier 
that is reproduced in the output to enable users to identify the 
source of the chosen primers.<br>
<br>
This tag must be present if <a href="#P3_FILE_FLAG">P3_FILE_FLAG</a> is non-zero.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE (nucleotide sequence; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>The sequence from which to choose primers.  The sequence
must be presented 5' -> 3' (i.e, in the normal way).
In general, the bases may be upper or lower case, but 
lower case letters are treated 
specially if <a href="#PRIMER_LOWERCASE_MASKING">PRIMER_LOWERCASE_MASKING</a> is set.
The entire sequence MUST be all on a single line. 
(In other words, the sequence cannot span several lines.)
</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION (interval list; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>A sub-region of the given sequence in which to pick primers.  For
example, often the first dozen or so bases of a sequence are
vector, and should be excluded from consideration. The value for
this parameter has the form</p>
<pre>
<tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt>
</pre>
<p>where <tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt> is the index of the first base to consider,
and <tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt> is the number of subsequent bases in the
primer-picking region.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_TARGET">SEQUENCE_TARGET (interval list; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>If one or more targets is specified then a legal primer pair must
flank at least one of them.  A target might be a simple sequence
repeat site (for example a CA repeat) or a single-base-pair
polymorphism, or an exon for resequencing.  The value should be a space-separated list of</p>
<pre>
<tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt>
</pre>
<p>pairs where <tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt> is the index of the first base of a
target, and <tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt> is its length.</p>


See also PRIMER_INSIDE_PENALTY, PRIMER_OUTSIDE_PENALTY.
Has a different meaning when PRIMER_TASK=pick_sequencing_primers.
See PRIMER_TASK for more information.


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_EXCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_EXCLUDED_REGION (interval list; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>Primers and oligos may not overlap any region specified in this tag.
The associated value must be a space-separated list of</p>
<pre>
<tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt>
</pre>
<p>pairs where <tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt> is the index of the first base of
the excluded region, and <tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt> is its length.  This tag is
useful for tasks such as excluding regions of low sequence
quality or for excluding regions containing repetitive elements
such as ALUs or LINEs.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_PRIMER_PAIR_OK_REGION_LIST">SEQUENCE_PRIMER_PAIR_OK_REGION_LIST (semicolon separated list of integer "quadruples"; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>

This tag allows detailed specification of possible
locations of left and right primers in primer pairs.
<br><br>
The associated value must be a semicolon-separated list of</p>

<pre>
<tt><i>&lt;left_start&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;left_length&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;right_start&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;right_length&gt;</i></tt>
</pre>
<p>quadruples.

The left primer must be in the region specified by 
<tt><i>&lt;left_start&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;left_length&gt;</i></tt> and 
the right primer must be in the region specified by
<tt><i>&lt;right_start&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;right_length&gt;</i></tt>.

<tt><i>&lt;left_start&gt;</i></tt> and <tt><i>&lt;left_length&gt;</i></tt> specify the location of the left primer in terms of the index of
the first base in the region and the length of the region.

<tt><i>&lt;right_start&gt;</i></tt> and <tt><i>&lt;right_length&gt;</i></tt> specify the location of the right primer in analogous fashion.

As seen in the example below, if no integers are specified for a region then the location of the
corresponding primer is not constrained.

<br><br>
Example:</p>
<pre>
SEQUENCE_PRIMER_PAIR_OK_REGION_LIST=100,50,300,50 ; 900,60,, ; ,,930,100
</pre>
<p>
<br>
Specifies that there are three choices:
<br><br>
Left primer in the 50 bp region starting at position 100 AND right primer
in the 50 bp region starting at position 300
<br><br>
OR
<br><br>
Left primer in the 60 bp region starting at position 900 (and right primer anywhere)
<br><br>
OR
<br><br>
Right primer in the 100 bp region starting at position 930 (and left
primer anywhere)
</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_OVERLAP_JUNCTION_LIST">SEQUENCE_OVERLAP_JUNCTION_LIST (space separated integers; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>If this list is not empty, then
the forward OR the reverse primer must overlap one of 
these junction points by at least <a href="#PRIMER_MIN_3_PRIME_OVERLAP_OF_JUNCTION">PRIMER_MIN_3_PRIME_OVERLAP_OF_JUNCTION</a> 
nucleotides at the 3' end and at least <a href="#PRIMER_MIN_5_PRIME_OVERLAP_OF_JUNCTION">PRIMER_MIN_5_PRIME_OVERLAP_OF_JUNCTION</a> 
nucleotides at the 5' end.
<br><br>
In more detail: The junction associated with a given position is the space immediately to the right
of that position in the template sequence on the strand given as input.
<br><br>
For example:</p>
<pre>
<code>
SEQUENCE_OVERLAP_JUNCTION_LIST=20
# 1-based indexes
PRIMER_MIN_3_PRIME_OVERLAP_OF_JUNCTION=4

template: atcataggccatgcctgagc^gctacgact

          ok           ...gagc^gcta-3'  (left primer)
          not ok       ...gagc^gct-3'   (left primer)
          ok           3'-ctcg^cgat...  (right pimer)
          not ok        3'-tcg^cgat...  (right primer)

PRIMER_MIN_5_PRIME_OVERLAP_OF_JUNCTION=5

         ok           5'-tgagc^gccg...  (left primer)
         not ok        5'-gagc^gccg...  (left primer)
         ok           ...tgagc^gctac-5' (right primer)
         not ok       ...tgagc^gcta-5'  (right primer)

</code>
</pre>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_EXCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_EXCLUDED_REGION (interval list; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>Middle oligos may not overlap any region specified by this tag.
The associated value must be a space-separated list of</p>
<pre>
<tt><i>&lt;start&gt;</i></tt>,<tt><i>&lt;length&gt;</i></tt>
</pre>
<p>pairs, where &lt;start&gt; is the index of the first base of
an excluded region, and &lt;length&gt; is its length.  Often one would
make Target regions excluded regions for internal oligos.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_PRIMER">SEQUENCE_PRIMER (nucleotide sequence; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>The sequence of a left primer to check and around which to design
right primers and optional internal oligos.  Must be a substring
of <a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_OLIGO">SEQUENCE_INTERNAL_OLIGO (nucleotide sequence; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>The sequence of an internal oligo to check and around which to
design left and right primers.  Must be a substring of 
<a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_PRIMER_REVCOMP">SEQUENCE_PRIMER_REVCOMP (nucleotide sequence; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>The sequence of a right primer to check and around which to
design left primers and optional internal oligos.  Must be a
substring of the reverse strand of <a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a>.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_START_CODON_POSITION">SEQUENCE_START_CODON_POSITION (int; default -2000000)</a></h3>

<p>This parameter should be considered EXPERIMENTAL at this point.
Please check the output carefully; some erroneous inputs might
cause an error in primer3.<br>
<br>
Index of the first base of a start codon.  This parameter allows
primer3 to select primer pairs to create in-frame amplicons
e.g. to create a template for a fusion protein.  Primer3 will
attempt to select an in-frame left primer, ideally starting at or
to the left of the start codon, or to the right if necessary.
Negative values of this parameter are legal if the actual start
codon is to the left of available sequence. If this parameter is
non-negative primer3 signals an error if the codon at the
position specified by this parameter is not an ATG.  A value less
than or equal to -10^6 indicates that primer3 should ignore this
parameter.<br>
<br>
Primer3 selects the position of the right primer by scanning
right from the left primer for a stop codon.  Ideally the right
primer will end at or after the stop codon.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_QUALITY">SEQUENCE_QUALITY (space separated integers; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>A list of space separated integers. There must be exactly
one integer for each base in <a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a> if this argument is
non-empty.  For example, for the sequence ANNTTCA...
<a href="#SEQUENCE_QUALITY">SEQUENCE_QUALITY</a> might be 45 10 0 50 30 34 50 67 ....
High numbers indicate high confidence in the base called at
that position and low numbers indicate low confidence in the
base call at that position.  This parameter is only relevant
if you are using a base calling program that provides
quality information (for example phred).</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_FORCE_LEFT_START">SEQUENCE_FORCE_LEFT_START (int; default -1000000)</a></h3>

<p>Forces the 5' end of the left primer to be at the indicated 
position. Primers are also picked if they violate certain
constraints. The default value indicates that the start of the left primer
can be anywhere.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_FORCE_LEFT_END">SEQUENCE_FORCE_LEFT_END (int; default -1000000)</a></h3>

<p>Forces the 3' end of the left primer to be at the indicated 
position. Primers are also picked if they violate certain
constraints. The default value indicates that the end of the left primer
can be anywhere.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_FORCE_RIGHT_START">SEQUENCE_FORCE_RIGHT_START (int; default -1000000)</a></h3>

<p>Forces the 5' end of the right primer to be at the indicated 
position. Primers are also picked if they violate certain
constraints. The default value indicates that the start of the right primer
can be anywhere.</p>


<h3><a name="SEQUENCE_FORCE_RIGHT_END">SEQUENCE_FORCE_RIGHT_END (int; default -1000000)</a></h3>

<p>Forces the 3' end of the right primer to be at the indicated 
position. Primers are also picked if they violate certain
constraints. The default value indicates that the end of the right primer
can be anywhere.</p>


<h2><a name="globalTags">9. "GLOBAL" INPUT TAGS</a></h2>

<p>"Global" input tags start with PRIMER_... and describe the 
general parameters that primer3 should use in its searches. 
The values of these tags persist between input Boulder 
records until or unless they are explicitly reset. Errors 
in "Global" input tags are fatal because they invalidate 
the basic conditions under which primers are being picked.<br>
<br>
Because the laboratory detection step using internal oligos is 
independent of the PCR amplification procedure, internal oligo 
tags have defaults that are independent of the parameters that 
govern the selection of PCR primers. For example, the melting 
temperature of an oligo used for hybridization might be 
considerably lower than that used as a PCR primer.

   <a href="#SEQUENCE_PRIMER_REVCOMP">SEQUENCE_PRIMER_REVCOMP</a>. It is the only task that does not
   require a sequence. However, if <a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a> is provided, it is used.
   <br>

   <tt><i>pick_primer_list</i></tt><br>
<br>
   Pick all primers in <a href="#SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE">SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE</a> (possibly
   limited by <a href="#SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION</a>, 
   <a href="#SEQUENCE_EXCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_EXCLUDED_REGION</a>,

   <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER">PRIMER_PICK_RIGHT_PRIMER</a> is selected primer3 does not to pick 
   primer pairs but generates independent lists of left primers, right primers,
   and, if requested, internal oligos.<br>
<br>
   <tt><i>pick_sequencing_primers</i></tt><br>
<br>
   Pick primers suited to sequence a region. <a href="#SEQUENCE_TARGET">SEQUENCE_TARGET</a> can be 
   used to indicate several targets. The position of each primer is 
   calculated for optimal sequencing results.<br>
<br>
   <tt><i>pick_cloning_primers</i></tt><br>
<br>
   Pick primers suited to clone a gene were the start nucleotide and 
   the end nucleotide of the PCR fragment must be fixed, for example 
   to clone an ORF. <a href="#SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION</a> must be used to 
   indicate the first and the last nucleotide. Due to these 
   limitations primer3 can only vary the length of the primers. Set

<br>
   <tt><i>pick_discriminative_primers</i></tt><br>
<br>
   Pick primers suited to select primers which bind with their end at 
   a specific position. This can be used to force the end of a primer 
   to a polymorphic site, with the goal of discriminating between
   sequence variants. <a href="#SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION">SEQUENCE_INCLUDED_REGION</a> must be used to

of elements of the form</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>where an <tt><i>&lt;x&gt;-&lt;y&gt;</i></tt> pair is a legal range of lengths for the
product.  For example, if one wants PCR products to be between
100 to 150 bases (inclusive) then one would set this parameter to
<tt><i>100-150</i></tt>.  If one desires PCR products in either the range from
100 to 150 bases or in the range from 200 to 250 bases then one
would set this parameter to <tt><i>100-150 200-250</i></tt>.<br>
<br>
Primer3 favors product-size ranges to the left side of the parameter string.
Primer3 will return legal primers pairs in the first range
regardless the value of the objective function for pairs in subsequent ranges.

Only if there are an insufficient number of primers in the first
range will primer3 return primers in a subsequent range.<br>
<br>

the PCR product size is the size (in base pairs)

A similar formula is used by the prime primer selection program
in GCG (<a href="http://www.gcg.com">http://www.gcg.com</a>), which instead uses 675.0 / length in
the last term (after F. Baldino, Jr, M.-F. Chesselet, and M.E.
Lewis, Methods in Enzymology 168:766 (1989) eqn (1) on page 766
without the mismatch and formamide terms).  The formulas here and
in Baldino et al. assume Na+ rather than K+.  According to
J.G. Wetmur, Critical Reviews in BioChem. and Mol. Bio. 26:227
(1991) 50 mM K+ should be equivalent in these formulae to .2 M
Na+.  Primer3 uses the same salt concentration value for
calculating both the primer melting temperature and the oligo
melting temperature.  If you are planning to use the PCR product
for hybridization later this behavior will not give you the Tm
under hybridization conditions.</p>

<p>
<p>
A value to use as nanomolar (nM) concentration of each annealing oligo 
over the course the PCR.
Primer3 uses this argument to esimate oligo melting
temperatures. This parameter corresponds to 'c' in equation (ii) 
of the paper [SantaLucia (1998) A unified view of polymer, dumbbell, 
and oligonucleotide DNA nearest-neighbor thermodynamics. 
Proc Natl Acad Sci 95:1460-1465
<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/95/4/1460.full.pdf+html">http://www.pnas.org/content/95/4/1460.full.pdf+html</a>],
where a suitable value (for a lower initial concentration of template) 
is "empirically determined".<br>
<br>
The default (50nM) works well with the standard
protocol used at the Whitehead/MIT Center for Genome 
Research--0.5 microliters of 20 micromolar concentration for each
primer in a 20 microliter reaction with 10 nanograms
template, 0.025 units/microliter Taq polymerase in 0.1 mM each
dNTP, 1.5mM MgCl2, 50mM KCl, 10mM Tris-HCL (pH 9.3) using 35
cycles with an annealing temperature of 56 degrees Celsius.<br>
<br>
The value of this parameter is less than the actual
concentration of oligos in the initial reaction mix because it is the
concentration of annealing oligos, which in turn depends on the
amount of template (including PCR product) in a given cycle.
This concentration increases a great deal during a PCR;
fortunately PCR seems quite robust for a variety of oligo melting
temperatures.

<h3><a name="PRIMER_MAX_SELF_ANY">PRIMER_MAX_SELF_ANY (decimal, 9999.99; default 8.00)</a></h3>

<p>PRIMER_MAX_SELF_ANY describes the tendency of a primer to bind to 
itself (interfering with target sequence binding). It will score 
ANY binding occurring within the entire primer sequence.<br>
It is the maximum allowable local alignment score when testing 
a single primer for (local) self-complementarity and the 
maximum allowable local alignment score when testing for 
complementarity between left and right primers.  Local 
self-complementarity is taken to predict the tendency of primers 
to anneal to each other without necessarily causing self-priming 
in the PCR.  The scoring system gives 1.00 for complementary 
bases, -0.25 for a match of any base (or N) with an N, -1.00 for 
a mismatch, and -2.00 for a gap. Only single-base-pair gaps are 
allowed. For example, the alignment</p>
<pre>
   5' ATCGNA 3'
      || | |
   3' TA-CGT 5'
</pre>
is allowed (and yields a score of 1.75), but the alignment
<pre>
   5' ATCCGNA 3'
      ||  | |
   3' TA--CGT 5'
</pre>
<p>is not considered.  Scores are non-negative, and a score of 0.00
indicates that there is no reasonable local alignment between two
oligos.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_MAX_SELF_ANY_TH">PRIMER_MAX_SELF_ANY_TH (decimal, 9999,99; default 47.00)</a></h3>

<p> The same as PRIMER_MAX_SELF_ANY but all calculations are based on
	  thermodynamical approach. The melting temperature of the most stable
	  structure is calculated. To calculate secondary structures nearest-neighbor
	  parameters for perfect matches, single internal mismatches, terminal
	  mismatches, dangling ends have been used. Also parameters for
increments for length dependence of
bulge and internal loops have been used. This parameter is calculated only
if PRIMER_THERMODYNAMIC_OLIGO_ALIGNMENT=1. The default value is 10 degrees
lower than the default value of PRIMER_MIN_TM. For example, the alignment
width length 15nt</p>
<pre>
  5' ATTAGATAGAGCATC 3'
  3' TAATCTATCTCGTAG 5'
</pre>
is allowed (and yields a melting temperature of 32.1493

<h3><a name="PRIMER_MAX_SELF_END">PRIMER_MAX_SELF_END (decimal, 9999.99; default 3.00)</a></h3>

<p>
PRIMER_MAX_SELF_END tries to bind the 3'-END to a identical primer 
and scores the best binding it can find. This is critical for 
primer quality because it allows primers use itself as a target 
and amplify a short piece (forming a primer-dimer). These primers 
are then unable to bind and amplify the target sequence.<br>
PRIMER_MAX_SELF_END is the maximum allowable 3'-anchored global 
alignment score when testing a single primer for 
self-complementarity, and the maximum allowable 3'-anchored 
global alignment score when testing for complementarity between 
left and right primers. The 3'-anchored global alignment score 
is taken to predict the likelihood of PCR-priming primer-dimers, 
for example</p>
<pre>
   5' ATGCCCTAGCTTCCGGATG 3'
                ||| |||||

</pre>
<p>The scoring system is as for the Maximum Complementarity
argument. In the examples above the scores are 7.00 and 6.00
respectively. Scores are non-negative, and a score of 0.00
indicates that there is no reasonable 3'-anchored global
alignment between two oligos.  In order to estimate 3'-anchored
global alignments for candidate primers and primer pairs, Primer
assumes that the sequence from which to choose primers is
presented 5'->3'. It is nonsensical to provide a larger value
for this parameter than for the Maximum (local) Complementarity
parameter (<a href="#PRIMER_MAX_SELF_ANY">PRIMER_MAX_SELF_ANY</a>) because the score of a local 
alignment will always be at least as great as the score of a 
global alignment.</p>

constraints.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_LOWERCASE_MASKING">PRIMER_LOWERCASE_MASKING (int; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>This option allows for intelligent design of primers in sequence in
which masked regions (for example repeat-masked regions) are
lower-cased.  (New in v. 1.1.0, added by Maido Remm and Triinu
Koressaar)<br>
<br>
A value of 1 directs primer3 to reject primers overlapping
lowercase a base exactly at the 3' end.<br>
<br>
This property relies on the assumption that masked features
(e.g. repeats) can partly overlap primer, but they cannot overlap
the 3'-end of the primer.  In other words, lowercase bases at
other positions in the primer are accepted, assuming that the
masked features do not influence the primer performance if they
do not overlap the 3'-end of primer.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG">PRIMER_EXPLAIN_FLAG (boolean; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>If this flag is 1 (non-0), produce <a href="#PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN</a>,
<a href="#PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN</a>, <a href="#PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN</a> and/or
<a href="#PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN</a> output
tags as appropriate.  
These output tags are intended to provide information on the number of
oligos and primer pairs that primer3 examined and counts of
the number discarded for various reasons.  If -format_output is
set similar information is produced in the user-oriented output.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_LIBERAL_BASE">PRIMER_LIBERAL_BASE (boolean; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>This parameter provides a quick-and-dirty way to get primer3 to
accept IUB / IUPAC codes for ambiguous bases (i.e. by changing
all unrecognized bases to N).  If you wish to include an
ambiguous base in an oligo, you must set <a href="#PRIMER_MAX_NS_ACCEPTED">PRIMER_MAX_NS_ACCEPTED</a> to a
1 (non-0) value.<br>
<br>
Perhaps '-' and '* ' should be squeezed out rather than changed
to 'N', but currently they simply get converted to N's.  The authors
invite user comments.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_FIRST_BASE_INDEX">PRIMER_FIRST_BASE_INDEX (int; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>This parameter is the index of the first base in the input
sequence.  For input and output using 1-based indexing (such as
that used in GenBank and to which many users are accustomed) set
this parameter to 1.  For input and output using 0-based indexing
set this parameter to 0.  (This parameter also affects the
indexes in the contents of the files produced when the primer
file flag is set.)</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING">PRIMER_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING (decimal, 9999.99; default -1.00)</a></h3>

<p>The maximum allowed similarity to ectopic sites in the

system is the same as used for <a href="#PRIMER_MAX_LIBRARY_MISPRIMING">PRIMER_MAX_LIBRARY_MISPRIMING</a>, except
that an ambiguity code in the template is never treated as a
consensus (see <a href="#PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS">PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS</a>).</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING_TH">PRIMER_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING_TH (decimal, 9999.99; default -1.00)</a></h3>

<p>Similar to <a href="#PRIMER_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING">PRIMER_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING</a> but 
assesses alternative binding sites in the template using thermodynamic models
(when PRIMER_THERMODYNAMIC_TEMPLATE_ALIGNMENT=1).
This parameter specifies the maximum allowed
melting temperature of an oligo (primer)
at an "ectopic" site within the template sequence; 47.0 would be
a reasonable choice if <a href="#PRIMER_MIN_TM">PRIMER_MIN_TM</a> is 57.0.
</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_PAIR_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING">PRIMER_PAIR_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING (decimal, 9999.99; default -1.00)</a></h3>

<p>The maximum allowed summed similarity of both primers to
ectopic sites in the template. A negative value means do not
check.  The scoring system is the same as used for
<a href="#PRIMER_PAIR_MAX_LIBRARY_MISPRIMING">PRIMER_PAIR_MAX_LIBRARY_MISPRIMING</a>, except that an ambiguity code 
in the template is never treated as a consensus (see
<a href="#PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS">PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS</a>).  Primer3 does not
check the similarity of hybridization oligos (internal
oligos) to locations outside of the amplicon.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_PAIR_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING_TH">PRIMER_PAIR_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING_TH (decimal, 9999.99; default -1.00)</a></h3>

<p>The maximum allowed summed melting temperatures
of both primers at ectopic sites within the template (with
the two primers in an orientation that would allow PCR
amplification.) 
The melting temperatures are calculated
as for <a href="#PRIMER_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING_TH">PRIMER_MAX_TEMPLATE_MISPRIMING_TH</a>.

<h3><a name="PRIMER_MISPRIMING_LIBRARY">PRIMER_MISPRIMING_LIBRARY (string; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>The name of a file containing a nucleotide sequence library of
sequences to avoid amplifying (for example repetitive sequences, or
possibly the sequences of genes in a gene family that should
not be amplified.)  The file must be in (a slightly restricted)
FASTA format (W. B. Pearson and D.J. Lipman, PNAS 85:8 pp
2444-2448 [1988]); we briefly discuss the organization of this
file below.  If this parameter is specified then primer3 locally
aligns each candidate primer against each library sequence and
rejects those primers for which the local alignment score times a
specified weight (see below) exceeds <a href="#PRIMER_MAX_LIBRARY_MISPRIMING">PRIMER_MAX_LIBRARY_MISPRIMING</a>.
(The maximum value of the weight is arbitrarily set to 100.0.)<br>
<br>
Each sequence entry in the FASTA-format file must begin with an
"id line" that starts with '>'.  The contents of the id line is
"slightly restricted" in that primer3 parses everything after any
optional asterisk ('*') as a floating point number to use as the
weight mentioned above.  If the id line contains no asterisk then
the weight defaults to 1.0.  The alignment scoring system used is
the same as for calculating complementarity among oligos (e.g.
<a href="#PRIMER_MAX_SELF_ANY">PRIMER_MAX_SELF_ANY</a>), except for the handling of IUB/IUPAC ambiguity
codes (discussed below).<br>
<br>
The remainder of an entry contains the sequence as lines
following the id line up until a line starting with '>' or
the end of the file.  Whitespace and newlines are ignored.
Characters 'A', 'T', 'G', 'C', 'a', 't', 'g', 'c' and
IUB/IUPAC 'ambiguity' codes ('R, 'Y', 'K', 'M', 'S', 'W',
'N', including lower case) are retained. For technical
reasons the length of the sequence must be >= 3. Of course,
sequences of length < 10 or so are probably useless, but
will be accepted without complaint.<br>
<br>
WARNING: always set <a href="#PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS">PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS</a>=0
if any sequence in the library contains strings of 'N's:
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN.<br>
NOWWW<br>
There are no restrictions on line length.<br>
<br>
An empty value for this parameter indicates that no repeat
library should be used and "turns off" the use of a
previously specified library.<br>

Repbase (J. Jurka, A.F.A. Smit, C. Pethiyagoda, and
others, 1995-1996, <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/repbase/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/repbase/</a>)
is an excellent source of repeat sequences and pointers to the
literature. (The Repbase files need to be converted to Fasta
format before they can be used by primer3.)</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_INTERNAL_MISHYB_LIBRARY">PRIMER_INTERNAL_MISHYB_LIBRARY (string; default empty)</a></h3>

<p>Similar to <a href="#PRIMER_MISPRIMING_LIBRARY">PRIMER_MISPRIMING_LIBRARY</a>, except that the event we

<h3><a name="PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS">PRIMER_LIB_AMBIGUITY_CODES_CONSENSUS (boolean; default 0)</a></h3>

<p>If set to 1, treat ambiguity codes as if they were consensus
codes when matching oligos to mispriming or mishyb
libraries. For example, if this flag is set, then a C in an
oligo will be scored as a perfect match to an S in a library
sequence, as will a G in the oligo. More importantly,
though, any base in an oligo will be scored as a perfect
match to an N in the library.  This is very bad if the
library contains strings of Ns, as no oligo will be legal
(and it will take a long time to find this out). So unless
you know for sure that your library does not have runs of Ns
(or Xs), then set this flag to 0.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_MAX_LIBRARY_MISPRIMING">PRIMER_MAX_LIBRARY_MISPRIMING (decimal, 9999.99; default 12.00)</a></h3>

<a href="#PRIMER_PAIR_WT_DIFF_TM">PRIMER_PAIR_WT_DIFF_TM</a>, etc.) the running time of the 
search for primer pairs is likely to grow substantially. The 
reason is that the search algorithm must calculate the penalty

<p>Non-default values are valid only for sequences with 0 or 1
target regions.  If the primer is part of a pair that spans a
target and overlaps the target, then multiply this value times
the number of nucleotide positions by which the primer overlaps

<h3><a name="PRIMER_OUTSIDE_PENALTY">PRIMER_OUTSIDE_PENALTY (float; default 0.0)</a></h3>

<p>Non-default values are valid only for sequences with 0 or 1

<h2><a name="outputTags">10. OUTPUT TAGS</a></h2>

<p>For each Boulder-IO record passed into primer3 via stdin, exactly
one Boulder-IO record comes out of primer3 on stdout.
If a settings file is provided and the option to echo the settings file is given
on the command line, then the contents of the settings file will also be
part of the output. Two additional tags are used to indicate where the 
records of the settings file begin and end: P3_SETTINGS_FILE_USED specifies
the path to the settings file that was provided, P3_SETTINGS_FILE_END
does not have any value and it just indicates the end of the settings records.<br>
<br>
The output records contain everything that the input record contains, plus a
subset of the following tag/value pairs.  Unless noted by (*),
each tag appears for each primer pair returned.<br>
<br>
Tags are of the form PRIMER_{LEFT,RIGHT,INTERNAL,PAIR}_&lt;j&gt;_&lt;tag_name&gt;
where &lt;j&gt; is an integer from 0 to n, where n is at most the 
value of <a href="#PRIMER_NUM_RETURN">PRIMER_NUM_RETURN</a>. In the documentation the output 
number 4 is shown as for example: <a href="#PRIMER_LEFT_4_TM">PRIMER_LEFT_4_TM</a>.<br>
<br>
In the descriptions below, 'i,n' represents a start/length pair,
's' represents a string, x represents an arbitrary integer, and f
represents a float.</p>
<h3><a name="PRIMER_ERROR">PRIMER_ERROR=s (*)</a></h3>

<p>s describes user-correctable errors detected in the input
(separated by semicolons).  This tag is absent if there are no
errors.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_WARNING">PRIMER_WARNING=s (*)</a></h3>

<p>s lists warnings generated by primer3` (separated by semicolons);
this tag is absent if there are no warnings.</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_LEFT_NUM_RETURNED">PRIMER_LEFT_NUM_RETURNED=i</a></h3>
<h3><a name="PRIMER_RIGHT_NUM_RETURNED">PRIMER_RIGHT_NUM_RETURNED=i</a></h3>
<h3><a name="PRIMER_INTERNAL_NUM_RETURNED">PRIMER_INTERNAL_NUM_RETURNED=i</a></h3>
<h3><a name="PRIMER_PAIR_NUM_RETURNED">PRIMER_PAIR_NUM_RETURNED=i</a></h3>

<p>i is the number of primers
or primer pairs returned on standard output. 
These tags are always generated under
IO version 4 if there are no internal errors and
if <a href="#PRIMER_ERROR">PRIMER_ERROR</a> is not present.<br>
<br>
If primer pairs were requested, 
PRIMER_LEFT_NUM_RETURNED and
PRIMER_RIGHT_NUM_RETURNED will be equal to the
number of pairs returned, even if the
actual number of distinct left or right primers
was lower than the number of pairs.  If primer
pairs with internal oligos were requested,
PRIMER_INTERNAL_NUM_RETURNED will also be set
to the number of pairs returned.<br>
<br>
If only left or right primers or hybridization
(internal) oligos were requested, PRIMER_PAIR_NUM_RETURNED
will be 0 and only the relevant tag
will have a non-zero value.
For example, if only left primers were requested, 
PRIMER_RIGHT_NUM_RETURNED, PRIMER_INTERNAL_NUM_RETURNED and 
PRIMER_PAIR_NUM_RETURNED will be 0.<br>
<br>
Some tasks, such as pick_sequencing_primers or
pick_primer_list, return left and right primers
that are not parts of primer pairs. In this case 
PRIMER_PAIR_NUM_RETURNED will be 0.

<h3><a name="PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN=s (*)</a></h3>
<h3><a name="PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN=s (*)</a></h3>

<p>s is a (more or less) self-documenting string containing
statistics on the possibilities that primer3 considered in
selecting a single oligo.  For example</p>
<pre>
PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN=considered 62, too many Ns 53, ok 9
PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN=considered 62, too many Ns 53, ok 9
PRIMER_INTERNAL_OLIGO_EXPLAIN=considered 87, too many Ns 39, overlap excluded region 40, ok 8
</pre>
<p>
All the categories are exclusive, except the 'considered' category.
In some cases the ok count may be higher than the actual number 
of ok oligos. This is because a primer can be considered as part of
pair before all of the primer's characteristics have been
computed and checked.  If a primer is never in a legal
pair or never in a pair with a fully evaluated penalty, then
this may occur.  This 
situation never results in a primer pair that contains
an illegal primer.
</p>


<h3><a name="PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN=s (*)</a></h3>

<p>s is a self-documenting string containing statistics on picking a
primer pair (plus internal oligo if requested).  For example</p>
<pre>
PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN=considered 81, unacceptable product size 49, no internal oligo 32, ok 0
</pre>
The purpose of this string is to provide information
in the case that not enough primer pairs are returned.  This
information can be used, for example, to decide
which constraints to relax. In some cases the
information in this string can also give insight into
the causes of long running time.

The counts in the string are only approximate,
because of several reasons:

<ul>

<li>When there are multiple <a href="#PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE">PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE</a>s,
a primer pair may not be ok in one size range but ok
in another.  Approximately, the counts for each statistic
are summed over all product size ranges. 
</li>

<li>When <a href="#PRIMER_MIN_THREE_PRIME_DISTANCE">PRIMER_MIN_THREE_PRIME_DISTANCE</a>
is &gt; -1, the number of ok primer pairs 
reported may be larger than the actual
number. The discrepancy is due to a primer
in the pair that would overlap a primer in a
'better' (lower penalty) pair.  (The search
algorithm does not record state 
that would allow it to detect 
when a pair that was formerly ok becomes
not ok as the result of
another primer being inserted
into the output list before it is.)
</li>

<li>In some instances, 
primer3 will examine a primer pair before it
discovers that one of the individual
primers in the pair violates specified
constraints.  In this case 
<a href="#PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_PAIR_EXPLAIN</a> might have a non-0
number 'considered', even though one or more of
<a href="#PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_LEFT_EXPLAIN</a>, <a href="#PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_RIGHT_EXPLAIN</a>, or
<a href="#PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN">PRIMER_INTERNAL_EXPLAIN</a> has 'ok 0'.

<h2><a name="calculatePenalties">12. HOW PRIMER3 CALCULATES THE PENALTY VALUE</a></h2>

<p>
In essense, the penalty values define what is the best primer
pair.
The calculation of penalty values
takes into consideration penalty weights, which allow
one to fine-tune the selection of primers to specific needs.<br>
<br>
This section will explain the selection process of primers by 
primer3. In general the selection is a multi step process:<br>
<br>
In the first step, primer3 evaluates every primer that 
can be picked in the region of interest, possibly subject to
constraints due to target regions, product size ranges, and
so forth, that might preclude the use of primers in the
eventually selected primer pairs. In this pass the hard 
limits are tested like <a href="#PRIMER_MAX_GC">PRIMER_MAX_GC</a> or <a href="#PRIMER_MIN_TM">PRIMER_MIN_TM</a>. Primers 
with a GC lower than <a href="#PRIMER_MAX_GC">PRIMER_MAX_GC</a> or a Tm higher than 
<a href="#PRIMER_MIN_TM">PRIMER_MIN_TM</a> are memorized, the primers which fail in one of 
these tests are excluded. Primer3 can be forced to use primers 
failing to pass this test by setting <a href="#PRIMER_PICK_ANYWAY">PRIMER_PICK_ANYWAY</a> to one 
(only available for primers provided by the user).<br>
<br>
In the second step, primer3 calculates a penalty for each
primer. This penalty is the only score by which primer3 
evaluates the primers It is also provided as output 
<a href="#PRIMER_LEFT_4_PENALTY">PRIMER_LEFT_4_PENALTY</a>, <a href="#PRIMER_INTERNAL_4_PENALTY">PRIMER_INTERNAL_4_PENALTY</a> and 
<a href="#PRIMER_RIGHT_4_PENALTY">PRIMER_RIGHT_4_PENALTY</a> (shown for the primer set 4). For each 
primer, it is calculated like that:</p>

product size limits.</p>

<h2><a name="webInterface">13. PRIMER3 WWW INTERFACES</a></h2>

<p>There are two web interfaces available :<br>
The Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research provides a basic
web-based front end to primer3 named primer3web at
<a href="http://primer3.wi.mit.edu/">http://primer3.wi.mit.edu/</a><br>
<br>
A Primer3plus web services is at
<a href="http://primer3plus.com">http://primer3plus.com</a><br>
<br>
This distribution does not contain the Primer3 WWW interfaces.<br>
<br>
Web interface code is available at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/primer3/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/primer3/</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="acknowledgments">14. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</a></h2>

<p>Initial development of Primer3 was funded by Howard Hughes Medical
Institute and by the National Institutes of Health, National Human
Genome Research Institute under grants R01-HG00257 (to David C. Page)
and P50-HG00098 (to Eric S. Lander),
but ongoing development and maintenance are not currently funded.
<br>
<br>
Primer3 was originally written by Helen J. Skaletsky (Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, Whitehead Institute) and Steve Rozen (Duke-NUS
Graduate Medical School Singapore, formerly at Whitehead Institute)
based on the design of earlier versions, notably Primer 0.5
(Steve Lincoln, Mark Daly, and Eric S. Lander).
The original web interface was designed by Richard Resnick.  Lincoln
Stein designed the Boulder-IO format in the days before XML and RDF, and
championed the idea of making primer3 a software component, which
has been key to its wide utility.<br>
<br>
In addition, among others, Ernst Molitor, Carl Foeller, and James Bonfield
contributed to the early
design of primer3. Brant Faircloth has helped with 
ensuring that primer3 runs on Windows and MacOS and with the
primer3 web site. 
Triinu Koressaar and Maido Remm modernized the melting 
temperature calculations in 2008.  
Triinu Koressaar added secondary structure, 
primer-dimer, and template mispriming based on a thermodynamic
model in 2.2.0.
Ioana Cutcutache is responsible for most of the 
remaining improvements
in 2.2.0, including performance enhancements, modern
command line arguments, and new input tags to 
control primer location (with the "overlap junction"
tags initially implemented by Andreas Untergasser).
Jian Ye patiently provided new requirements.<br>
<br>
Harm Nijveen and Andreas Untergasser developed the webinterface 
Primer3Plus in 2006-2009. Currently Primer3Plus is maintained by 
Andreas Untergasser.
<br>
<br>
Primer3 is an open software development project hosted
on SourceForge: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/primer3/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/primer3/</a>.</p>
